# How to read this documentation

**Work in progress.**

This documentation is like a guide. I write it because I would like to have to begging with a documentalike like this.

There is two langages : [english](en/README.md) and [french](fr/README.md)

The direction `todo_notes` contains information to process and cleaned up.
